## Midterm Project Rubric (Applied to This Project)

### Grading Breakdown
- **Full Functionality of 3 Major Features – 70%**
  - Authentication (Supabase email/password)
  - Practice Sessions (problems, code execution, results)
  - Dashboard Analytics (stats, charts, recent activity)

- **Percentage of JavaScript Converted to TypeScript – 20%**
  - Target: convert meaningful modules to TypeScript, with types and build step
  - Evidence: `tsconfig.json`, `package.json` scripts, `.ts` sources, emitted JS

- **UI "Coolness" (subjective) – 10%**
  - Modern visual polish, motion, responsiveness, and micro-interactions

### Extra Credit
- Implementing one or two additional fully-functional features earns extra credit (quality over quantity).
  - Examples: Problem bookmarking, spaced-repetition review queue, social share of progress.

### Checklists (Required)
- Each major feature includes a 5–7 item checklist (with error conditions) in `docs/FEATURE_CHECKLISTS.md` used for evaluation.
