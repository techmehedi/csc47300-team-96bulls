## UI "Coolness" Checklist (10%)

Focus: clarity + modern visuals + motion without hurting performance or readability.

1. Consistent visual language (color, spacing, glassmorphism) across pages.
2. Smooth micro-interactions on buttons/cards/links (hover/active, depth, lighting).
3. Motion: subtle section entrances; reduced-motion respected (prefers-reduced-motion).
4. Responsive: mobile/tablet/desktop layouts optimized; no horizontal scrolling.
5. Readability/contrast verified for dark theme; code/outputs legible.
6. Delight elements: animated gradient borders, iconography, progress animations.
7. Performance: animations under 60fps, images optimized, no layout thrash.
