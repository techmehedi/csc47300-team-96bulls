          An idea we've come up with for our web application will help students and 
          job-seekers prepare for coding interviews by simulating the experience of solving 
          <strong>LeetCode-style questions</strong>. Users can select a topic 
          and difficulty level from dropdown menus, then an AI agent will 
          generate a coding challenge and act as the interviewer in a live 
          chat pane. On the right side, users can write and test their code 
          in a built-in editor.
